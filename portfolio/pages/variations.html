                    This assignment was to create an interior space in a 2 perspective view and in 4 different color combinations: neutral (top left), triadic (top right), monochrome (bottom left), and analogous (bottom right).
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to create an attractive kitchen space that was scaled correctly and felt welcoming. This was my first time playing with perspectives so I was very careful to follow guidelines. All the lines were drawn starting from the corner of the window to make the view feel like they were walking towards the kitchen looking for a snack or ready to cook.
                    <br><br>
                    After finishing the color combinations, I was pleased to find that each picture actually gave off a different feeling compared to the others. I think that this might have happened due to the range of colors I used throughout the combinations. This idea into a goal of mine as I move forward on my journey to put in consideration my audienceâ€™s emotions while they are viewing my designs.
