                <em>Summer of 2017, I bought a Fitbit Alta HR, a health and fitness tracker that can also work as a normal watch, during the Amazon Prime Day since I’ve been wanting 
                a watch and was trying to get into fitness. I’ve been using it every day ever since for not only time but tracking my steps, minutes of being active, and sleep 
                through the Fitbit app where all the data syncs to. </em>
            </p>

            <h3>I became more conscious of my physical actions because I became obsessed with making the daily goals.</h3>
            <p>
                For the past few years, I’ve been using the alarm function, where the Fitbit vibrates, to wake me up. One of the first things I do when I wake up is to check the 
                Fitbit app to see how many hours I slept and how I my sleep cycle was. I enjoy learning about my sleep and how long I was in each stage. Throughout the day when 
                I’m just casually checking my phone, I always tap on to the app to see how many steps I’ve taken. When I go to the gym, I always check my heart rate and after gym 
                I would check how many calories I burnt and how my heart rate fluctuates during workout. I think the Fitbit Alta HR has incorporated into the lives of normal people 
                like me who goes to school or work and it’s very fitting because it’s just enough for people who are looking to be more self aware of their habits and body while 
                having it be multifunctional. 
            </p>

            <h3>I can see how the Fitbit can be a good buy for people who wants an inexpensive fitness watch.</h3>
            <p>
                The Fitbit Alta HR is made for people who have the time to keep up with their fitness and want to invest in technology that will help them. It’s good for people 
                who just wants to have a check on stuff at an affordable price compared to something like an apple watch. The design of the product is slim and fits well on the 
                wrist and stylish without being too flashy. The model that I have normally retails for $150, which would be more than I would like to spend. But since I’ve been 
                looking for a watch, I decided to get it because it was on sale and my boyfriend recommended it. Basically, anyone who has a phone that can download the app and 
                the Fitbit will work. I think the product could totally be made so that an app isn’t necessary for it to work but because of the need to setup the fitness functions, 
                an app is required. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The first few days I ever wore it, I felt stylish, adult-like, and cool because I had a digital fitness watch around my wrist. I find the Fitbit Alta HR relatively 
                easy to use for people who are already familiar with technology. The functions very convenient and comes in handy. For example, it senses motion so when you bring 
                your wrist up, the watch turns on and you can see the time and tap to see other trackers without using the app. As I went on with my day, I felt my fitbit vibrate 
                when I got a new message. This easily became my favorite function because when I’m at work, I could still see my messages without getting in trouble because it just 
                looks like I’m checking the time on my watch.
            </p>

            <h3>My Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, I think the Fitbit Alta HR made a pretty big change in how I go on about my day. I always want to make my step goals and make sure I get seven hours of sleep. 
                Since I had the tracking to help me, it is much easier to visualize my habits and it motivates me more to move when I see that my goals were not met. I think that anyone 
                that uses a Fitbit Alta HR just uses it as a practical piece of technology to help themselves keep track of their own activity and become more aware of their own body.
