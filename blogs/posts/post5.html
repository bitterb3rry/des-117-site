                In my future designs, I want to learn how to incorporate playful element. I feel that it can really help engage the audience and perhaps help them feel 
                good and relaxed while using or looking at my designs and it's something that I would like my brand to represent. This article from Smashing Magazine by Jhey Tompkins has a list of really cool ways to include <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/playfulness-code-supercharge-fun-learning/">playfulness</a> 
                while web designing. Even if it’s something pointless and stupid, it’s wonderful to see that pixels on a screen and make someone smile or laugh. I might take me 
                a little time to find my own unique touch of fun but I am inspired by the examples in the article.

                I’ve been using Figma when designing for prototypes for class assignments but I never officially looked at any tutorials on how to use all that’s on Figma. I've also found 
                this article from Smashing Magazine which is a guide on some <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/speed-up-workflow-figma-plugins/">helpful plugins</a> that can come in handy while using Figma. 
                I think it is really cool since this allows for other people to create little helper functions to do task that can useful during designing projects. I will use this as a 
                starting point for exploring through plugins and hopefully finding some I will like to use.
