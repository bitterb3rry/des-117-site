            <h2>Web Design: Mobile VS Desktop</h2>
            <h3>By Julia Ma</h3>

            <h4 class="subtitle">Bit Project</h4>
            
            <p>
                One page I decided to checkout is the <a href="https://www.bitproject.org/">Bit Project</a> webpage, a student run non-profit which I work for. After looking at both desktop and mobile versions of the same page, I found that all the features you can see on the desktop can also be seen on the mobile version
                dispite the size change. 
            </p>
            
            <img src="../images/bit_webpage.png" alt="bit project webpage" width="700px">

            <img src="../images/bit_moblie1.png" alt="bit project mobile page" height="450px"> 
            <img src="../images/bit_moblie2.png" alt="bit project mobile navigation bar" height="450px">
            
            <p>
                One way Bit Project was able to do so it hiding the navigation bar using the hamburger icon where as the desktop version displayed the navigation
                bar at the top. This trick for the moblie saved space and possible fustration from the visitor trying to press small buttons to use the navigation. I also found that it was
                smart to break up the centered words and images on the side in the mobile version. The desktop layout would have been way to crowded for the mobile version. This way, the 
                aesthetics can stay while having a readable page.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="subtitle">Youtube</h4> 
            <br>
            <img src="../images/youtube_webpage.png" alt="youtube webpage" width="700px">

            <p>
                Another page I checked out is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?reload=9">YouTube</a> since I use the desktop and app version daily but have not really interacted with the mobile site.
                <br><br>
                I viewed both desktop and mobile versions without logging in and one of the first things I noticed is that the mobile version has way less tabs avliable for visitors
                to explore whereas the desktop version has a whole side bar with recommended generes and such. This might be harder for visitors who are not logged in on the mobile site to explore 
                as many generes as a desktop user would although mobile still has access the the home page, trending, and library.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/youtube_mobile.png" alt="youtube mobile page" height="450px">

            <p>
                Another thing I noticed is that the mobile site really reminds me of the app version as there is the navigation bar on the bottom with the video thumbnails front and center, accessible with scrolling in 
                the middle. This may be a good idea to keep consistency between mobile versions of the service.
