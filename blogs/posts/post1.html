                When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, it revolutiozed the way people would now interact with technology. It wasn't 
                too long ago when people first has access to the internet. Neither was the internet really accessible for the everyday 
                person since it required that you own a computer that can connect to the internet. What Apple created with the iPhone 
                is basically a portable mini computer for the everyday person.

                Before the iPhone, the smartphone was a chunky phone with a keyboard that took up half the surface which left almost no 
                space for a nice screen. What Apple did was taking a leap from a physical keyboard to a virtual keyboard that only showed up when
                you needed it. This revolutionary UI enable the phone to be a much more usable piece of technology where accessing the internet 
                for all its users.

                From that point on, the internet became no stranger to the public. The internet is no longer a place that exists through 
                a computer screen. It's become a necessity to daily life whether you have questions how-to's or a recipe for tonight's dinner 
                or the directions to your nearest coffee shop. All it takes a reach in the pocket and a fingerprint scan to answer your next questions.
                This new product leads to many more questions on how Apple's new ways of thinking has inspired other tech companies to make
                revolutionary products as well.
