                Poppins is geometric and san serif in nature. The characters are wide, the descenders are shorter, and the counters are nearly perfect circles. 
                It was first released as an open-source typeface on Google fonts so it's free to use for anyone.

                Below is an example of Poppins at work.

                I do like how this website chose to use Poppins for their font since their website is filled with geometry. I think the website also is using Poppins for it's smaller texts.
                Poppins does range have a big range from thin to thick meaning that it's avaliable to be used for a wide range of purposes.

                Personally, I think Poppins is a really nice typeface to use with a big size. When it's a big size, you can really see the clean geometric style and it's great at taking up white space.
